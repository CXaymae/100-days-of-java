/* Formatting options such as precision, alignment, and decimal places are used to present output in a clear and concise manner.

Precision refers to the number of digits or decimal places displayed in a numeric value. It allows you to control the level of detail in the output. For example, you can specify the number of decimal places to display after the decimal point.

Alignment is used to control the spacing and alignment of the output. It allows you to format text or numbers in a visually appealing way. For example, you can align text to the left, right, or center, and specify a fixed width for each field.

Decimal places determine the number of digits to display after the decimal point in a floating-point number. It is useful when working with decimal values or when you need to limit the precision of a calculation result. */
